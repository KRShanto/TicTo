## Home page

The home page doesn't contain much, just a link to the game page.

## Game page

The game page contains the game itself. The game is played on a 3x3 grid. The game is played by two players, X and O. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game is a draw.
